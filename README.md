## Abstract

An R Shiny based [interactive ML platform](https://boyuan.shinyapps.io/AIV_Classifier/) was constructed for modeling train-test simulation and category prediction of unknown AIV sample(s). This new method presents a robust and rapid approach to quantifying free amino acids in plants for use in evaluating plants, biofortification, botanical authentication, safety, adulteration and with applications to nutrition, health and food product development.

## R Script Reference
The R code has been developed with reference to [R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), and the official documentation of [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), and [**DataBrewer.co**](https://www.databrewer.co/). See breakdown of modules below:

- Data visualization with ggplot2 ([tutorial](https://www.databrewer.co/R/visualization/introduction) of the fundamentals; and [data viz. gallery](https://www.databrewer.co/R/gallery)).

- [Data wrangling](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling) with the following packages:
[tidyr](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/tidyr/introduction): transform (e.g., pivoting) the dataset into tidy structure; [dplyr](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/dplyr/0-introduction): the basic tools to work with data frames; [stringr](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/stringr/0-introduction): work with strings; [regular expression](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/regular-expression/0-introduction): search and match a string pattern; [purrr](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/purrr/introduction): functional programming (e.g., iterating functions across elements of columns); and [tibble](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/tibble/introduction): work with data frames in the modern tibble structure.
