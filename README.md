## Free amino acids in African indigenous vegetables: Analysis with improved hydrophilic interaction ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and interactive machine learning

See [original article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021967320310074) published in J. Chroma A. 

This work studied the free amino acids in African indigenous leafy vegetables (AIVs). The R script constructed and presented here are for various analysis purpose in the four following parts:

##### Part I. UHPLC HILIC - MS/MS method development and validation 
##### Part II. Analysis of AIVs free amino acids with exploratory data analysis

##### Part III. AIV classification prediction based on machine learning (ML) methods

##### Part IV. ML-baed interactive prediction using R-Shiny.

The R code has been developed with reference to [R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), and the official documentation of [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), and [**DataBrewer.co**](https://www.databrewer.co/). See breakdown of modules below:

- Data visualization with ggplot2 ([tutorial](https://www.databrewer.co/R/visualization/introduction) of the fundamentals; and [data viz. gallery](https://www.databrewer.co/R/gallery)).

- [Data wrangling](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling) with the following packages:
[tidyr](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/tidyr/introduction): transform (e.g., pivoting) the dataset into tidy structure; [dplyr](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/dplyr/0-introduction): the basic tools to work with data frames; [stringr](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/stringr/0-introduction): work with strings; [regular expression](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/regular-expression/0-introduction): search and match a string pattern; [purrr](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/purrr/introduction): functional programming (e.g., iterating functions across elements of columns); and [tibble](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/tibble/introduction): work with data frames in the modern tibble structure.
