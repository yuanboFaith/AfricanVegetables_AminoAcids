# Free amino acids in African indigenous vegetables: Analysis with improved hydrophilic interaction ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and interactive machine learning

See [original article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021967320310074) published in J. Chroma A. 

This work studied the free amino acids in African indigenous leafy vegetables (AIVs). The R script constructed and presented here are for various analysis purpose in the four following parts:

##### Part I. UHPLC HILIC - MS/MS method development and validation
 
##### Part II. Analysis of AIVs free amino acids with exploratory data analysis

##### Part III. AIV classification prediction based on machine learning (ML) methods

##### Part IV. ML-baed interactive prediction using R-Shiny.
